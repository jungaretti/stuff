# Stuff for macOS

Apps and tools for macOS.

## Getting Started

> "Ed una lupa, che di tutte brame sembiava carca ne la sua magrezza, e molte genti fé già viver grame" ([Infero I, 49-51](https://digitaldante.columbia.edu/dante/divine-comedy/inferno/inferno-1/)).

I use [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) to install my apps and tools. It's not perfect, but it's the best option out there.

### Prerequisites

- [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) for installing applications and tools
- [mas-cli](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) for installing Mac App Store applications

## Installing

Clone this repo and install my stuff using `./install.sh`. **This will take quite a while to complete.**

```sh
gh repo clone jungaretti/stuff-macos
cd stuff-macos

./install.sh
```
